# [Project 1: Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression (R)](https://github.com/anatolii-kolesov/ds_code/blob/main/classification_r/churn_prediction_with_logistic_regression.html)
### Overview
In this project I developed a logistic regression model to predict customer churn in a bank and estimated the time to churn with survival function.
The goal of the project was to identify the most important factors influencing customer churn and the average tenure of a customer before they churn.

### Results
- A Logistic Regression model was able to predict customer churn correctly with 78% accuracy.
- The most important factors for predicting churn are clientâ€™s place of residence, number of products they have and being an active member. Tenure, age and gender might also influence churn.
- On average, bank has ~ 10 months before the customer becomes very likely to churn. Keep in mind that this shows that the bank has been operating for a short period so far and it might change.

# [Project 2: Customer Satisfaction Prediction with Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression (Python)](https://github.com/anatolii-kolesov/ds_code/tree/main/classification_python)
### Overview 
This project describes the development of a machine learning solution that would allow to predict the satisfaction of customers of an airline compnay based on individual satisfaction scores, features of customers, such as age, gender, and conditions of flights, such as distance traveled and arrival/departure delay.

The models were trained and tested on a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction).

### Executive summary
Three machine learning models were developed using Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Trees (DT), and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms.

With model tuning, the highest testing accuracy levels achieved with each algorithm were the following:

- Naive Bayes - 86.7%
- Decision Tree - 95%
- Logistic Regression - 87.3%

Decision Tree algorithm yeilded the highest accuracy and given its easy interpretability is deemed to be the best solution for this problem.
